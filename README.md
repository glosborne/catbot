# CatBot for Discord

CatBot is an incredibly simple Discord bot.  You send it the command '+meow' and it returns a random joke about cats.  That's it.

## Using the public bot

If you want to invite CatBot to your existing server, just point your browser at https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=686054770141692080&scope=bot .

## Requirements

To run the bot code on your system, you'll need node.js and npm.


## Installation

### Running the code yourself

Please see this article for directions on how to set up a Discord bot.  It's a longish process.  
Just use this project's index.js instead of the article's.  You will need to set up your own package.json
file; follow the article's instructions.

## Usage

In the Discord server running CatBot, type:

```
+meow
```

A random cat joke will be returned to the channel.


## Support

## Notes

The jokes were copied into a text file from https://bestlifeonline.com/cat-jokes/ 
in case you're wondering where they came from.  I did not write them myself.  Feel free to send me more jokes!
